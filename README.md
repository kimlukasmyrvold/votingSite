This website was created due to a school project where the task was to make website where you could vote on different political parties that exists in Norway. The site had to connect to a database where the parties and voting information would be stored. The votes also had to be anonymous.
Voters also should not be able to vote more than once, and can only vote for parties in the municipality that they belong to.

The project was created with ASP.NET Web Application (using .net framework) and Microsoft SQL Server.
